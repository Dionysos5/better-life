# better-life
Open source web application to create powerful habits for a better life. 

The user will be able to pick from a list of core habits like writing, programming, working out or communicating. He will be shown how to create that habit with baby steps and will be able to track his progress with streaks, receiving reminders and advice along the way. The mechanisms of this app will be designed in an optimal way to create lasting habits with minimal friction. 

This project was inspired by James Clear's book **Atomic Habits**
